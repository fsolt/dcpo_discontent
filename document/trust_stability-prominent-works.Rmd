# Prominent Works
## 1) Theoretical Works
- @VanderMeer2017 has a good discussion of the conceptulization of "political trust", such as the subjects of political trust, and its distinction with related concepts, such as "political support", skepticism, etc.
- @Almond1963 argue that the sense of trust in the political elite makes citizens willing to turn power over to them, and, the maintenance of elite power is essential in a democracy.
- @hetherington1998political provides a comprehensive overview of the debates surrounding the political relevance of political trust. One classic approach views political trust as stemming from the assessment of incumbents and institutions, akin to specific support, and posits limited political relevance toward the regime. In contrast, the other classic approach regards political trust as akin to diffuse support. Therefore, while political trust may be influenced by the evaluation of regime performance, it can also significantly contribute to negative evaluations of the regime.Two mechanisms were discussed in this context:1) Diminishing trust in political institutions calls into question the legitimacy of democracy, which is founded on these institutions. 2) Distrust leads to disapproval, which in turn hinders leaders' ability to mobilize resources to address issues, resulting in fewer problems being solved. Consequently, distrust creates conditions conducive to further distrust.
- @martin2010does provides a good summary of old debate over the political relevance of political trust. Arthur Miller (1974), Stokes (1962), and Almond and Verba (1963) proposed that the public's sentiments toward government, including political trust, play a crucial role in the stability of the regime overall. However, Citrin (1974) presents a contrasting viewpoint, arguing that low political trust primarily stems from dissatisfaction with incumbents and does not significantly impact diffuse support for democracy.
- @dawson2024political provides a good summary of the critical citizen thesis that comparatively lower levels of political trust is not a threat to democracy but a sign of a health democracy. While “critical” or “assertive” citizens exercising their democratic right to publicly criticize and challenge political institutions may decrease trust in those institutions, these challenges are thought to be an important aspect of – and therefore not threaten – the democratic political system. So, low political trust is not a threat to the regime.
- @mishler2005political suggests three mechanism in detail that how low institutional trust can threten the stability of democracy. 1) Institutional trust increases diffuse support for democracy or public support for democratic regime, 2) Higher institutional trust facilitates the public’s acceptance of democratic values and ideals and its rejection of undemocratic alternatives and 3) Higher institutional trust promotes both the quality and quantity of political involvement. 


## 2) Empirical Works
- @Marien2011 examine the relation between trust in the institutions of the political system and law-abiding attitudes using the 1999–2001 European Values Study. In this study, "political trust" is operationalized as an index summing up trust in parliament, in the justice system, in the armed forces, and in the police. They find citizens with low levels of trust feel it more acceptable to break the law, such as commit tax fraud.
- @Dalton2004 reports that there is a rising trend of political distrust in advanced industrial democracies, which may erode the vitality of democracy and bring political change. Citizens who do not trust government and institutions appear to be less willing to comply with the law and the directives of government. Distrustful citizens also appear to be less involved in the traditional channels of representative democracy, such as voting and campaign activity, but are more likely to seek influence through protest and other direct forms of action.
- @hetherington2005trust explores the consequences political trust on policy level, using the case of public support for redistributive programs in the U.S. He finds that, as political trust declines, citizens tend to prefer smaller government, even though their values do not become less liberal. In a later study, @hetherington2012trust show the effect of political trusts dependent on political issue's salience and media coverage.
- @hetherington1998 used Structural Equation Modeling with 1988 and 1996 NES, and political trust is measured by asking four questions about one's trust in the government in Washington. The result demonstrates that political trust is related to the diffuse and specific support. Specifically, trust's effect on feelings about the incumbent president, a measure of specific support, is even stronger than the reverse. However, it is not the case for feelings about Congress
- @martin2010does utilizes data from the 2007 Australian Election Study (AES) to investigate political trust, measured through a question regarding trust in government. Employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) analysis, the findings indicate that greater trust in government correlates with more favorable attitudes toward democracy, although it does not impact anti-democratic sentiments. Furthermore, higher levels of trust are associated with an increased voting intention.
- @dawson2024political empirically tests the critical citizen thesis by using WVS and EVS from 1981 to 2020. Political trust is measured by one's trust in six political institutions – the civil service, police, justice system/courts, parliament, government and political parties. The results provides a support for the critical citizens thesis that the level of democracy is negatively related to political trust.
